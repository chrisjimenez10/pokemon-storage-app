## MEN Stack CRUD App
### * This application has two features: One that offers the user an option to create their own pokemon and the other to fetch pokemon from the Pokemon API. 
### * The technologies used for this application was the MEN Stack because it allows the dynamic generation of show pages based on the input of the user. The pokemon created or added by the user to their pokmeon storage is also saved in the database to preserve the data upon closing the application.
### * Some challenges were integrating both the create feature using HTML forms to capture data from user with the fetching of data from the Pokemon API. Overriding schemas, parsing nested objects, and route placement in the server file.
### * Future features include a battle system where pokemon fight each other, and a carousel that cycles through the pokmeon in the storage.
